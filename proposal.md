## Description
It will be like a game where you are a duck character and need to collect objects to get your score up. It is relevant to digital arts because I will create the duck sprite and code it into the game to create something new using both art and tech.

## Features
- Duck Sprite PNG
	- It will be pixel art of a duck and I will use some of the lesson videos more specifically those in 'C07: Image Processing'. 
- Player Controls
	- I will be letting the player control the duck sprite with basic keys like 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'. I will look in Pythons website to see some ways of implementing keyboard input. Perhaps using Pygames 'pygame.event.get()' and 'pygame.KEYDOWN'.
- Random Colored Objects/Random Placement
	- I will use the 'random.randrange()' command to make each object a different color for the player to collect as well as having it have different placements. For these I will use the lesson videos in 'C08: Graphics & OOP'.

## Challenges
- Learn how to get the duck going diagonally when pressing two corresponing keys like 'W' and 'A'.
- How to import the sprite and get it moving
- How to get the objects to dissapear after the duck "eats" them

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The duck sprite will move and collect the different colored objects. No real objective to the game, just playing as long as wanted until player gets bored. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Everything works, no bugs, the programs runs smoothly and is entertaning. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create Sprite and Import
  2. Get some code down for it to move

- Week 2
  1. Create the random colored/placed objects
  2. Get the duck to "eat" the objects

- Week N (Final)
  1. Go back through code and add anything that is deemed necessary
  2. Test and Finalize
